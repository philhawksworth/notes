  <div class="content">@whalecoiner I spoke at this once.
About 900 people in my talk.
I don't think I had more than 2 conversations the whole time I was there.

I skipped the speaker dinner because it had 200 people. (Which is a conference of its own... I wonder if there were speakers... and if they had a dinner)</div>
